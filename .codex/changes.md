# Change Log

## Step 1
- Initialized external Ameba project `ameba-river`.
- Added project-level `AGENTS.md` and `.codex` workflow documents.
- Replaced default single-file example with layered directories for `core`, `voice`, `cloud`, `diag`, and `app`.
- Chose a custom staged skeleton instead of copying `speechmind` directly because `speechmind` is not exposed through the SDK `new-project -a` example path and would add too much bring-up risk for the first board-verification cycle.
- Added a first runnable feature set:
  - boot banner and status reporting
  - monitor command `river`
  - text echo path
  - simulated device control for `light`, `fan`, `curtain`, and `socket`
- Reserved stable interfaces for future local VAD, wake word, offline ASR, and real online control transport.

## Step 1.1
- Added a project-side CMake bootstrap to pre-generate `build_info.h` placeholders in `menuconfig/project_{ap,hp,lp}`.
- This works around an SDK parallel-build race seen on `RTL8730E`, where `wifi_tunnel_app` may compile before the SDK-generated `build_info.h` exists.

## Step 1.2
- Captured `RTL8730E` EVB board knowledge from the user-provided hardware guide into `.codex/knowledge.md`.
- Recorded bring-up-critical hardware facts for future implementation:
  - LOGUART and reset baseline
  - NOR/NAND and download implications
  - audio input and amplifier constraints
  - restricted GPIOs on `RTL8730EAM`
  - SWD and antenna rework notes
- Kept the original EVB PDF in `.codex` so project decisions can be traced back to the source document.

## Step 2
- Enabled the project-side audio framework and passthrough build options needed for board audio bring-up.
- Added `river_voice_echo_*` in `components/river_voice`:
  - `AudioRecord` capture from `AMIC1 + AMIC3`
  - `AudioTrack` playback to speaker
  - fixed `1000 ms` ring-buffer delay
  - short capture warm-up mute to reduce startup pop/noise
- Extended the `river` monitor command with:
  - `river audio start`
  - `river audio stop`
  - `river audio status`
  - `river audio echo <start|stop|status>`
- Kept the feature command-driven instead of auto-starting at boot so board validation can stay isolated and reversible.
- Verified the code path with a full local `RTL8730E` build after enabling audio framework support.
- Recorded the in-use board silk-screen as `EV730EA2 RO1` and kept the chip package / flash type as still-to-confirm hardware facts.

## Step 2.1
- Added serial-side audio echo diagnostics so capture and playback can be distinguished without changing the board wiring.
- Extended the monitor command with:
  - `river audio diag on`
  - `river audio diag off`
  - `river audio diag status`
- Added rolling `1 second` diagnostic logs from the echo task:
  - `cap_peak=[ch0,ch1]` for capture-side PCM peak
  - `play_peak=[ch0,ch1]` for delayed playback-side PCM peak
  - read/write success and failure counters
  - partial-read counter
- Exposed diagnostic state through `river audio status` so runtime state can be checked before and after starting the loop.
- Verified the diagnostic-enhanced build locally for `RTL8730E`.
