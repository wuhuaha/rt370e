# Verification

## Step 1
Build:
```bash
cd /root/ameba-river
source env.sh
ameba.py soc RTL8730E
ameba.py build -p
```

Runtime checks from monitor:
```text
river status
river echo hello from board
river device light on
river device fan toggle
river status
```

Expected behavior:
- boot log prints `ameba-river boot`
- `river status` prints local front-end mode and device states
- `river echo ...` prints the same text through the cloud stub path
- `river device ...` updates and prints device state

## Step 1.2
Reference baseline captured:
- Verified and recorded EVB defaults needed for bring-up and future hardware adaptation:
  - LOGUART `1500000 8N1`
  - USB and LOGUART download paths
  - NOR/NAND coexistence on EVB
  - audio path, amplifier, and `12V` safety note
  - `RTL8730EAM` GPIO restrictions
- Source document retained in `.codex` for traceability.

## Step 2
Build:
```bash
cd /root/ameba-river
source env.sh
ameba.py soc RTL8730E
ameba.py build -p
```

Runtime checks from monitor:
```text
river status
river audio status
river audio start
```

Manual check:
- Speak into the microphone array after `river audio start`.
- Wait about `1 second`.
- Confirm the captured voice is replayed from the speaker with an obvious fixed delay.
- Keep the speaker away from the microphones during this test to avoid strong acoustic feedback.

Stop and inspect:
```text
river audio stop
river audio status
river status
```

Expected behavior:
- `river audio start` prints the selected audio profile and reports `audio echo started`
- `river audio status` reports `audio_echo=running` while active
- Voice is replayed with approximately `1000 ms` delay
- `river audio stop` stops the loop and `river audio status` returns `audio_echo=stopped`

## Step 2.1
Build:
```bash
cd /root/ameba-river
source env.sh
ameba.py soc RTL8730E
ameba.py build -p
```

Runtime checks from monitor:
```text
river audio diag status
river audio diag on
river audio start
```

Manual check:
- Speak into the microphone array for at least `2-3 seconds`.
- Watch the repeating `[river][voice][diag] ...` line.
- After checking, stop the path:

```text
river audio stop
river audio diag off
river audio status
```

Expected behavior:
- `river audio diag on` changes status output to `audio_echo_diag=on`
- While echo is running, the board prints one diagnostic line about every `1 second`
- `read_ok` and `write_ok` continue increasing while the loop is healthy

Quick interpretation:
- `cap_peak` stays near `0` while speaking:
  - likely no useful microphone capture on the selected channels
- `cap_peak` is nonzero and `play_peak` becomes nonzero after the delay window:
  - capture, ring-buffer delay, and digital playback feed are all active
- `cap_peak` and `play_peak` both look healthy but no sound is heard:
  - likely analog output route, mute, amplifier, or board-level speaker path problem
- `read_fail` or `write_fail` increases:
  - treat this as an SDK/audio-driver issue before changing mic or speaker routing

## Step 2.2
Build and flash:
```bash
cd /root/ameba-river
source env.sh
ameba.py soc RTL8730E
ameba.py build -p
ameba.py flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 1500000 -m nor
```

Boot-time check from monitor:
- No manual `river` command is required in this step.
- Wait for boot to finish and look for these lines:

```text
[river][voice] boot audio echo diagnostics enabled
[river][voice] boot audio echo autostart enabled
[river][voice] audio echo config: 16000 Hz, 2 ch, 1000 ms delay, AMIC1+AMIC3 -> speaker
[river][voice] audio echo started
```

Manual check:
- Speak into the microphone array after boot completes.
- Wait about `1 second`.
- Watch the repeating `[river][voice][diag] ...` line and listen for delayed replay.

Expected behavior:
- `audio_echo=running` appears in the boot-time status dump
- diagnostics print automatically about every `1 second`
- no shell interaction is required to trigger the loop

## Step 2.3
Build:
```bash
cd /root/ameba-river
source env.sh
ameba.py soc RTL8730E
ameba.py build -p
```

Expected build result:
- the build succeeds with `CONFIG_RIVER_*` options taking effect in `river_app.c`, `river_voice_frontend.c`, and `river_diag_cmd.c`
- the boot-time echo autostart path is no longer compiled out accidentally

## Step 2.4
Build and flash:
```bash
cd /root/ameba-river
source env.sh
ameba.py soc RTL8730E
ameba.py build -p
ameba.py flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 1500000 -m nor
```

Boot-time expectation:
```text
[river][voice] audio echo config: 16000 Hz, 1 ch, 1000 ms delay, AMIC3 mono -> speaker
```

Manual check:
- After boot, speak close to the board microphone path used by `AMIC3`.
- Wait about `1 second`.
- Compare the result with the previous build:
  - whether idle speaker hiss/noise is reduced
  - whether delayed speech becomes distinguishable

Expected diagnostics:
- low-level background peaks may still exist, but the replayed idle noise should be reduced by the software gate
- speech should drive `cap_peak` above the gate threshold and appear on `play_peak` about `1 second` later

## Step 2.5
Build and flash:
```bash
cd /root/ameba-river
source env.sh
ameba.py soc RTL8730E
ameba.py build -p
ameba.py flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 1500000 -m nor
```

Boot-time expectation:
```text
[river][voice] boot speaker playback diagnostics enabled
[river][voice] boot speaker playback autostart enabled
[river][voice] speaker test config: 16000 Hz, 2 ch, 16-bit, dual-mono tone -> speaker
[river][voice] speaker test gain: hw=0.60 sw=1.00 amplitude=16000
[river][voice] speaker test pattern: 1000Hz 400ms, gap 200ms, 1500Hz 400ms, gap 1000ms
[river][voice] speaker test started
```

Expected repeating serial diagnostics:
```text
[river][voice][spk] segment=tone_a freq=1000Hz peak=6000 write_ok=...
[river][voice][spk] segment=gap_b freq=0Hz peak=0 write_ok=...
```

Manual check:
- No `river` shell command is required in this step.
- After boot completes, listen for a repeating pattern:
  - a medium-pitch beep
  - short silence
  - a higher-pitch beep
  - longer silence
- This pattern should repeat continuously until reset or power-off.

Interpretation:
- The repeating beep is clean and recognizable:
  - the direct speaker playback path is proven
  - remaining echo issues should be traced to capture routing or echo processing, not basic playback hardware

## Step 2.6
Build and flash:
```bash
cd /root/ameba-river
source env.sh
ameba.py soc RTL8730E
ameba.py build -p
ameba.py flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 1500000 -m nor
```

Boot-time expectation:
```text
[river][voice] boot audio echo diagnostics enabled
[river][voice] boot audio echo autostart enabled
[river][voice] audio echo config: 16000 Hz, 1 ch, 1000 ms delay, AMIC3 mono -> speaker
[river][voice] audio echo gain: hw=0.45 cap=0x20 gate=1024 mic=AMIC3 micbst=5dB
[river][voice] audio echo started
```

Expected diagnostics:
```text
[river][voice][diag] cap_peak=[...,0] play_peak=[...,0] read_ok=50 write_ok=50 read_fail=0 write_fail=0 partial=0
```

Manual check:
- No shell command is required.
- After boot completes, speak close to the microphone path for `2-3 seconds`.
- Wait about `1 second` for the delayed replay.
- Compare with previous results:
  - whether delayed speech is now audible
  - whether idle noise is acceptable
  - whether speech is still buried in noise

## Step 2.6.1
Build and flash:
```bash
cd /root/ameba-river
source env.sh
ameba.py soc RTL8730E
ameba.py build -p
ameba.py flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 1500000 -m nor
```

Boot-time expectation:
```text
[river][voice] audio echo config: 16000 Hz capture mono -> 16000 Hz playback dual-mono, 1000 ms delay, AMIC3 -> speaker
[river][voice] audio echo gain: hw=0.45 sw=1.00 cap=0x20 gate=1024 mic=AMIC3 micbst=5dB
```

Expected diagnostics:
- `cap_peak` remains meaningful while speaking
- `play_peak` remains meaningful about `1 second` later
- If this step works, the user should finally hear delayed replay because the playback format now matches the previously validated direct speaker test shape

## Step 2.6.2
Build and flash:
```bash
cd /root/ameba-river
source env.sh
ameba.py soc RTL8730E
ameba.py build -p
ameba.py flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 1500000 -m nor
```

Boot-time expectation:
```text
[river][voice] audio echo gain: hw=0.60 sw=1.00 pcm=x4 cap=0x20 gate=1024 mic=AMIC3 micbst=5dB
```

Manual check:
- Speak close to the microphone for `2-3 seconds`.
- Wait about `1 second`.
- Confirm whether the delayed replay is now comfortably audible.
- Also watch for clipping or harsh distortion because this step intentionally raises gain aggressively.

## Step 2.7
Build and flash:
```bash
cd /root/ameba-river
source env.sh
ameba.py soc RTL8730E
ameba.py build -p
ameba.py flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 1500000 -m nor
```

Boot-time expectation:
```text
[river][voice] board array: EV8730EA2/EV730EA2 linear-2mic-50mm primary=AMIC1 secondary=AMIC3 spacing=50mm
[river][voice] board array aux: AMIC5 reserved for future AFE/beamforming raw tap
[river][voice] aivoice-ready geometry: AFE_LINEAR_2MIC_50MM
[river][voice] audio echo config: 16000 Hz capture dual-mic -> 16000 Hz playback dual-mono, 1000 ms delay, AMIC1+AMIC3 mix -> speaker
[river][voice] audio echo array: linear-2mic-50mm spacing=50mm aivoice=AFE_LINEAR_2MIC_50MM aux=AMIC5(reserved)
```

Manual check:
- No `river` shell command is required in this step.
- Speak at the board from the normal frontal direction for `2-3` seconds.
- Wait about `1 second` and listen for delayed replay.
- Compare the result with the previous single-mic echo build:
  - whether voice loudness improves
  - whether front-facing speech is cleaner
  - whether both capture channels show activity in diagnostics

Expected diagnostics:
```text
[river][voice][diag] cap_peak=[..., ...] play_peak=[..., ...] read_ok=50 write_ok=50 read_fail=0 write_fail=0 partial=0
```

Quick interpretation:
- `cap_peak` channel 0 and channel 1 both move while speaking:
  - the `AMIC1 + AMIC3` pair is alive
- only one capture channel moves consistently:
  - one array leg or its gain/routing still needs adjustment
- delayed playback is present but noisy:
  - the dual-mic digital path works, but this raw average still needs AFE / beamforming / gain tuning
